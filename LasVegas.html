		 <p class="description"> The Las Vegas Strip is a part of South Las Vegas Boulevard. It is known for its high concentration of hotel resorts, casinos, restaurants, and shops. One of the places I went to many times was Caesar's Palace for dinner and shopping. Inside, the walls are painted as the sky and there is an indoor river with boat rides mimicking Venice, Italy.</p>

		 <p class="description"> Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area is in the desert filled with colorful rocks, most of them red, hence the name. Red Rock Canyon has a visitors center, a scenic 13-mile drive, and tons of trails for hiking and biking. Some trails are on flat land with low fauna and the occasional wildlife. Other trails are inside the canyon with paths along areas where you can climb on the rocks toward adventurous and sometimes challenging spots. It's a good car trip away from downtown Las Vegas, but it was worth the drive.</p>

		 <h2 class="place">New York-New York Hotel and Casino</h2>

		 <p class="description"> Located on the Strip, New York-New York Hotel and Casino has its own microcosm of NYC. They also have an arcade and a roller coaster with the cars designed to look like taxis.</p>


		 <h2 class="place"> Cirque du Soleil</h2>

		 <p class="description"> Cirque du Soleil is a variety of circus performances of a particular theme consisting of acrobat tricks, music, fancy lights, and dramatic dancing. Many of the locations are also on the Strip inside hotels. Personally, I'm not really into this type of art, but the people I went with loved it, so maybe you will too.</p>
