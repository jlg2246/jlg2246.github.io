		 <p class="description"> Universal Studios is also in Hollywood, but it deserves its own section. This famous attraction is a combination of an amusements park and film studios/sets. All of the rides have a theme of a specific movie or franchise. Some of my favorite rides are the Jurassic Park ride, the Simpsons ride, the Revenge of the Mummy ride An honorable mentions is the Descicalbe Me ride. I haven't gone to the Harry Potter attraction yet, but it's on my bucket list. Universal Studios also has shows daily, such as WaterWorld. Besides going on rides and eating, you must go on a studio tour! It's facinating. During the tour, you are riding a kart and go through different settings and sets. Some of them are even interactive. </p>

		 <p class="description"> Griffith Park is huge and contains green space and hiking trails. The observatory is planatarium with a giant swinging pendulum, a theater, a cafe, and halls full of education exhibits. I actually ended up at Griffith Observatory by accident, and I'm glad I did. I was following google maps after I typed in Hollywood Sign. I was able to see the Hollywood sign in the far distance at the observatory.</p>
