		 <p class="description"> Central Park is New York City's biggest and most famous park of them all. It's 843 acres and consists of large green spaces, historical sites, lakes, walking paths, sites for music performances, wildlife, and places to relax. It's beauty and uniqueness have made it a common setting in movie scenes.</p>

		<p class="description"> Grand Central Terminal is one of the two major train stations. Grand Central's shiny and magical aura have also resulted in it being features in movies. Besides trains, rail road tracks, and ticket counters, there are also many shops, a market, and a food court. Although most people buy their tickets using the automated machines or their phones, there are still a few operating ticket counters available, probably for the older folks who are not good at new technology.</p>

		 <p class="description"> The Met lies on Fifth Avenue in Central Park It's a massive arts museum with an eclectic range of history both in time and geography. For example, they have the following areas: European sculptures and decorative arts, medieval art, African art, Egyptian art, Asian art, American art, and modern art. Special exhibits rotate seasonally or annually. These exhibits have a specific themes or artist. On the roof, there is a garden where you can see central park and the Upper West Side skyline. It is very difficult to see the entire museum in one day, so multiple trips are a must. At the end of your visit, you should visit the gift shop. They sell many art history books and souvenirs. The food is overpriced, so don't come hungry or at least go to the food truck instead. </p>


		 <h2 class="place">American Museum of Natural History</h2>

		 <p class="description"> The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) is full of life, well... actually dead things that used to be alive. The taxidermy of animals consitues are large portion of the exhibits. There is a giant blue whale model hanging from a ceiling, and its 21,000 lbs and 94 feet long. My personal favorite attraction is the hall of biodiversity. The room is filled with animals, plants, and other organisms on the walls and in display cases. THe museum also has a gemstone and rock collection and  assembled dinosaur fossils. There is also an outer space area with interactive stations and educational texts and vivid photographs. The Hayden planatarium plays a short video inside. The AMNH also lies in Central Park, but it is in the Upper West Side. </p>
